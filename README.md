# Analysis and Forecasting on Tetouan Power Consumption Dataset

For this project concerning the modelling and prediction of an energy time series, three different approaches were compared: **ARIMA**, **UCM** and **ML**. 

The time series has a high frequency (one data every 10 minutes) and concerns energy consumption in the city of Tetouan in Morocco during 2017.

Different models were compared for each approach with the aim of minimizing the **MAE** (Mean Absolute Error) for the month of December 2017. The best result was achieved by the ARIMA model with a MAE of around 1020. 

In this repo you can find the code (**R** language), the report (in Italian) and the presentation slides. Moreover, the final predictions for the models are stored in the `Final predictions.csv` file.
